            My dream was to play in the Premier League, and finally, I have the
            opportunity to compete in this competition,” the Croatian
            exclusively told TNT Sports. “Especially after my first game, my
            first 90 minutes, I won the trophy - I couldn't have imagined a
            better start and hopefully, we continue that way.”
